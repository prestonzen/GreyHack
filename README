#Attack Flow
x a to get info about target
x b to scan target's libraries
x c to exploit on those libraries
x rlssh + x rl are made for 22 port ONLY
so, at first you'd like to do x installSSH on the remote machine
x z just switches users
x me - well, you can see this in the description
x upd is basically
apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade

--- Examples ---
#Corrupting target log files of the attacked server
x rl aserver
